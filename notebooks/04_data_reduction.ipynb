    "## Task 4 â€” Data Reduction (15 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this task, we reduce the size of the training dataset (originally ~62 MB zipped) while preserving classification performance. The objective is to produce reduced versions targeting 50%, 25%, and 10% of the original size.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our reduction pipeline includes:\n",
    "- **Fourier Transform**: Keeps only the top energy frequencies (`compress_fourier`)\n",
    "- **Piecewise Linear Approximation (PLA)**: Removes redundant values based on a maximum error threshold (`compress_pla`)\n",
    "- **Custom serialization**: Writes compressed signals to `.bin` files compatible with the original parser\n",
    "\n",
    "The following parameter combinations were used (obtained mostly via trial and error):\n",
    "- **50%**: `keep_ratio = 0.03`, `max_error = 15.0`\n",
    "- **25%**: `keep_ratio = 0.01`, `max_error = 22.0`\n",
    "- **10%**: `keep_ratio = 0.003`, `max_error = 35.0`\n",
    "\n",
    "* Assuming the original data resides in the folder called `data` located at the parent directory w.r.t. this notebook, the reduced training data files also will be located under that file."
